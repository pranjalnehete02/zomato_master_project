    2.@devbabel - 
      Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards       compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do             for you
      Simply, Babel can convert JSX syntax. 
      
    3.nodemon:
      nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file       changes in the directory are detected.
      
     4.mongoose:
      First be sure you have MongoDB and Node.js installed.
      Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides       schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
      
     5.cors:
     CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
     
     6.helmet:
     Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. This reusable React component wwill manage all of      your changes to the document head.

     7.bcryptjs:
     Optimized bcrypt in JavaScript with zero dependencies. Compatible to the C++ bcrypt binding on node.js and also working in        the browser. Using bcrypt is a secured way to store passwords in my database regardless of whatever language my app's            backend is built in. Salted hashing — Generating random bytes (the salt) and combining it with the password before hashing
     creates unique hashes across each user's password.
     
     8.jsonwebtoken: JSON Web Token is a standard used to create access tokens for an application. This was developed against            draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-08. It makes use of node-jws
     
     9.dotenv: 
      dotenv allows you to separate secrets from your source code. This is useful in a collaborative environment (e.g., work, or 
      open source) where you may not want to share your database login credentials with other people. Instead, you can share the 
      source code while allowing other people to create their own.
      
     10.passport-google-oauth:
      This module lets you authenticate using OAuth in your Node. js applications. By plugging into Passport, OAuth 
      authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports Connect-style 
      middleware, including Express.
     
     11.aws-sdk:
        Develop and deploy applications with the AWS SDK for JavaScript. The SDK provides first class TypeScript support and
        makes it easy to call AWS services using idiomatic JavaScript APIs to build Node. js, web, and mobile web applications.

     12.multer:
        Multer is a node. js middleware for handling multipart/form-data , which is primarily used for uploading files. It is 
        written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.

     15.axois:
     Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript which can be used in your front-end application and in your Node.js 
     backend. By using Axios it’s easy to send asynchronous HTTP request to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. The Axios 
     library can be used in your plain JavaScript application or can be used together with more advanced frameworks
